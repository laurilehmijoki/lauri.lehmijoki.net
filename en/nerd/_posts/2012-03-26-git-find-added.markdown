#### Finding out when a string was added to a Git repository

Sometimes you need to know then a certain string was added to Git. The script below can help you there. Save the script into a file named _git-find-added_ and place the file into a directory that's in your path.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/2205576.js"> </script>

Running the script prints you something like this:

<pre><code>$ git-find-added "em-websocket"
commit 91023e800726abad14ed682f638ded74d86fbb6b
+gem "em-websocket"
+    em-websocket (0.3.6)
+  em-websocket
--
commit c911bb2f741eafa4d52289e11fb97ce120cda1a8
+require 'em-websocket'
</code></pre>

You can process the output further by grepping the Git SHA1 from the output: 

`$ git-find-added "em-websocket" | grep -E "^commit" | cut -d " " -f 2`

Don't forget to take advantage of Git aliases. They are a great way to add functionality into Git and make them feel like they are part of Git core. To add a new alias, modify the  _~/.gitconfig_ and add into the \[alias\] section a new entry:

<pre><code>[alias]
  fa = "!git-find-added"</code></pre>

Now you can use _git-find-added_ by typing simply:

`$ git fa "em-websocket"`

Unfortunately Git aliases do not support Unix pipes; if you'd like to make the SHA1 grepping shorter, you could modify the original script by adding arguments into it.
