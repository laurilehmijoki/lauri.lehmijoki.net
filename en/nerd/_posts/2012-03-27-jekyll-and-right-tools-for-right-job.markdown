#### Jekyll as an example of a tool that lets you concentrate on the problem and skip irrelevant details

[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), the blog and web site tool for hackers, is an excellent tool for what its made for. Jekyll allows you to set up a web site in a few minutes. For example, if you would like to run this site on your computer, you could do it in three lines, assuming you have Ruby and RubyGems installed:

`sudo gem install jekyll`

`git clone git://github.com/laurilehmijoki/lauri.lehmijoki.net.git blog`

`cd blog && jekyll --server` 

The command `jekyll --server` converts the Markdown files and HTML templates into HTML files and starts up an HTTP server at your [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000). 

Modifying content is easy. If you would think that the front-page of this site definitely needs a picture of Jean-Luc Picard, you could edit the file _index.markdown_ in the blog directory, add the picture and see the starship captain right away on the browser.

## How Jekyll works

Jekyll is a static web site generator that produces .html files and other static files that can be deployed on a web server. Any web server that can serve static files will do. For example, you can use Amazon S3 for hosting your Jekyll site. Static files, no security or hosting problems, blazingly fast delivery. Jekyll is great for personal or team sites.

Jekyll has the following features:

- Content conversion engine
- Lightweight templating engine
- Plugin support
- Web server for local deployment of the site

The content conversion engine turns your blog texts and articles into HTML. You can use Markdown, the text format for web writers, in your documents, and Jekyll will automatically convert them into HTML. Writing in Markdown syntax instead of HTML lets you concentrate on the text and ideas in your mind. Its like having a WYSIWYG editor in your command-line interface.

The lightweight templating engine saves you from the burden of repeating things. It makes it trivial to maintain a list of your three latest blog posts on the front-page, for example.

Jekyll is designed to be extended. You can write your own plugins that convert eg LaTeX into HTML. In fact, the [built-in converters](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master/lib/jekyll/converters) themselves are made with the plugin system. In addition to converters, its possible to write new tags that emit data into the generated HTML files. The tags are written in Ruby, and they can do anything that Ruby scripts can.

Lastly, when you write your texts, its helps to see them in their final form. Jekyll's web server can automatically generate the site every time you save your Markdown file. Just refresh your browser and you see your site as re-generated by Jekyll.

## Jekyll is not for everybody

There exist a multitude of content management systems, CMSs, in the world. If you like writing, designing web site content structure and the command-line interface, Jekyll is probably the one for you. On the other hand, if you need to set up a site that a non-technical person is going to maintain, Wordpress might be a better option.

## Right tool for right job

Choosing the right tool for the right job is of paramount importance in programming and system implementation. With wrong tools you end up spending a lot of time in irrelevant intricacies of the particular technology, the time you could have spent on doing the actual thing you wanted to achieve.

Jekyll exhibits some **general properties of right tools for the right job**:

- **It allows you to concentrate on the domain "problem"**
  
  Right tools for the right job _really_ help you. They don't make your life more difficult, nor do they distract your concentration; instead, they let you put your mind on the actual problem you are trying to solve.

  Jekyll lets you focus on the content of the site and the structure of the documents. Writing in Markdown in VIM is closest connection you and your article can get (excluding paper and pencil). Jekyll also allows you to model the content structure as file system directories. With Markdown, templating and content structuring Jekyll becomes the [DSL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) of geek blogging.

- **It does one thing well**

  Right tools for the right job solve one problem well. They do not pretend to be all-around tools. 
  
  Jekyll is a superb web site tool for nerds. It does not intend to be the best CMS for everybody.

- **It has an enthusiastic user community**

  An active and enthusiastic user community proves that there's something valuable in a tool.

  Jekyll has plenty of [users](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/sites), and [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com) support it.
