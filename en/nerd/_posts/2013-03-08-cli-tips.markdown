## Bash history

When opening a new terminal, you probably want to see the history from all other
open windows. Add these into your `~/.bashrc`:

    shopt -s histappend # Append into history, don't rewrite when exiting terminal
    PROMPT_COMMAND='history -a' # Flush history on new prompt

### Event Designators, Word Designators and Modifiers

[Bash Event
Designators](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Event-Designators.html#Event-Designators)
refer to an event in Bash command history.

For example, you can repeat the previous command:

    !!

You might often need this:

    sudo !!

Use [Word
Designators](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Word-Designators.html#Word-Designators)
to pick a word from a Bash history event. Here is an example of how to use the
last argument of the previous command:

    echo hello world
    echo greetings, !$ # will print "greetings, world"

[Modifiers](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Modifiers.html#Modifiers)
let you alter the word you appointed with a Word Designator. For example, you
can substitute (`s`) a word with another:

    echo hello world
    echo hello !$:s/world/galaxy # will print "hello galaxy"

It's worthwhile to read through the original Bash documentation (see the links
above).

## Vi on the command-line prompt

If you know `vi` or `vim` better than `emacs`, you most likely find this setting
superb:

    set editing-mode vi # Add into ~/.inputrc

In the `vi` editing mode, you can enter the normal mode by pressing `Esc`.
Result: innumerable keystrokes saved.

Another useful feature in the `vi` editing mode is that pressing `v` in the
normal mode will open in `vim` the command you have typed so far.

## Bash combinations

Turn a Bash expression into a function to which you can pass multiple
parameters:

    scp {.vimrc,my-file.txt,.inputrc} super.server.com:~/

The above command will transfer the files *.vimrc*, *my-file.txt* and *.inputrc*
to a remote server.

## Aliases

Show disk usage of current directory and its subdirectories:

    alias du-sum="du -skc * | sort -n" # OS X
    alias du-sum="du --max-depth=1 . | sort -n" # Linux

Save countless keystrokes:

    alias g=git
