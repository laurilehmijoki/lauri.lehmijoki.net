#### Making it more sensible to invest into Unix shell configuration files

In Unix-like systems, configuration files are often called dotfiles. The name
derives from the convention of prefixing the names of such files with a dot.
Semantically, dotfiles imply auxiliary files. This is why `ls` prints them to
you only when you add the `-a` as in auxiliary parameter.

However, recently, the term dotfiles has expanded to comprise other files as
well: in GitHub several developers have repositories named "dotfiles". Those
repositories actually contain their version-controlled files under the Unix home
directory.  In this context, the term dotfiles denotes personal Unix shell
settings.

In this article I am going discuss why it is beneficial to keep dotfiles in Git
and have them stored in GitHub.

## Why bother?

In your home directory you will find several dotfiles. *.bash_profile* and
*.gitconfig* are examples that you are probably familiar with. Why bother
investing time into these files?

If you are a serious geek, you spend quite a lot of time on the command line.
Merging, SSH'ing and editing files with VIM, Emacs or friends might take a
significant amount of your typical day. Since these operations are affected by
dotfiles and time is precious, it makes sense to put some attention into how you
store and develop dotfiles.

Having dotfiles version-controlled and public has benefits. First, it becomes
sensible to invest time into them since – thanks to version control and GitHub –
they will be around for years to come. If your dotfiles are not tracked by a
version-control system such as Git, you are likely to treat them less carefully.
Moreover, you might be unwilling to develop them, since modifying them might
make your computer behave unexpectedly, and you have no means to revert back to
the previous state where the system worked as expected.

Second, since they are in GitHub, you can easily have multiple computers that
share the same dotfiles. Suddenly you start feeling at home on the command line,
since you can pull your settings from GitHub to any Mac or Linux. Furthermore,
it is useful to have the dotfiles on a public GitHub repository, since this
allows you to pull them on a short-lived virtual machine or a computer that you
do not entirely trust.

Third, well-tuned dotfiles increase gumption or enthusiasm, and thus make it
more likely that you want to stick to your craft in the future as well.

In addition to the rational reasons, investing into dotfiles pays back in
moments of delight and zen: version-controlled Unix home directory brings sense
of peacefulness; [handy Bash scripts speed up your daily shell operations and

your favorite text editor's configuration file will result in a transcendental
union between you and the computer.

## Usage, or how to put your home directory into GitHub

* Create a Git repository for your home directory with `cd ~ && git init`
* Add into Git the the files you consider as your personal configuration files
  (e.g., *.bash_profile*, *.gitconfig*, *.vimrc*, *.emacs*, *.initrc* or
  *.ackrc*)
* Put everything else into *.gitignore*, so that after each commit your working
  directory is clean (this is quite important)
* Create a repository called "dotfiles" into GitHub
* `git remote add origin git@github.com:yourusername/dotfiles.git`
* Make sure your version-controlled dotfiles do not contain any sensitive
  material such as passwords
* Push your local repository into GitHub
